AWS global infrastructure - AWS regions, AWS availability zones, AWS edge locations, AWS data centers

How to choose a region - 
    Compliance: with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves the region without a service provider's consent
    Proximity to customers: Reduced latency
    Available services within the region: new services and new features aren't available in all regions
    Pricing: varies from region to region

AWS availability zones - Each region has many availability zones. ususally 3, min is 3 and max is 6
