Two flavours of replication:
    CRR (Cross Region Replication)
    SRR (Same Region Replication)


S3 bucket in eu-west-1 and other S3 bucket in us-east-2, to do the replication, we need to do the following:
    Must enable versioning in source and destination buckets
    CRR: (two Region are different)
    SRR: (two Region are same)
    buckets can be in different accounts
    Copying is aysnc
    Must give proper IAM permission to S3.

Use cases: 
    CRR: Compliance, Lower latency access, replication across accounts.
    SRR: Log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts.
