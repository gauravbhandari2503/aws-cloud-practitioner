Composite Keys in a Single Table:

DynamoDB's single-table design allows you to store multiple types of related items in the same table and reference them by using composite keys (Partition Key and Sort Key).
For example, you could store both users and orders in a single table, with UserId as the partition key and a combination of Type and ID (e.g., User#user123 or Order#order789)
as the sort key.


// Single Table with Users and Orders
{
  "PK": "USER#user123",
  "SK": "USER#user123",
  "Name": "John Doe",
  "Email": "johndoe@example.com"
},
{
  "PK": "USER#user123",
  "SK": "ORDER#order789",
  "Product": "Laptop",
  "Quantity": 1
}

By querying on PK = "USER#user123", you can retrieve both the user data and all their orders in one query.
