Managed NFS (Network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2 instances.
EFS work with linux EC2 instances in multi AZs.
Highly available, scalable, and expensive (3 x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning.


EBS vs EFS
    EBS can be attached to single instance in a single AZ. 
    If we want to move from one AZ to another, we need to create snapshot and restore that snapshot to the new AZ.
    This is copy not an original EBS.

    Where as EFS can be mounted on multiple instances in multiple AZs.

EFS infrequent access (EFS-IA)
Storage class that is cost optimized for files not accessed everyday.
Upto 92% lower cost compared to EFS standard.
EFS will autmoatically move files to EFS-IA based on last time they were accessed.
