Amazon Machine Image

AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance.
    You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
    Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged.

AMI are built for a specific region (can be copied to other regions)

You can  launch EC2 instances from 
    A publci AMI: AWS provided
    Your own AMI: You build your own AMI and maintain yourself
    An AWS Marktetplace AMI: An AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

AMI process: 
    Start an EC2 instance and customise It
    Stop the instance (for data integrity)
    Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
    Launch instances from other AMIs
