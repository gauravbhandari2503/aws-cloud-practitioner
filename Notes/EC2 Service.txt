One of the most important services in AWS

Elastic cloud compute, used to do infrastructure as a service

It mainly consist in the capability of: 
    Renting Virtual machines (EC2) - Elastic Compute Cloud instance
    Storing data on virtual drives (EBS) - Elastic Block Store
    Distribute load across multiple machines (ELB) - Elastic Load Balancer
    Scaling the services using an auto-Scaling group (ASG) - Auto Scaling Group

EC2 sizing & configuration options
    OS - Mac, Windows, Linux
    How much compute power and cores (CPU)
    How much RAM
    How much storage
        Network attached (EBS & EFS)
        Hardware attached (Instance store)
    Network card 
        Speed of the card, Public IP address.
    Firewall rules 
        Security groups
    Bootstrap script (Configure at first launch): EC2 user data

EC2 user data 
    It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data script.
    Bootstrapping means launching commands when machine starts.
    That script is only run once at the instance first start.
    EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as
        Insatlling software
        Updating software
        Downloading files
        Anything
    The EC2 user data script runs with the root user.


instance
    Different types of instances for your use case.
    Free tier - t2.micro
    Public IP address changes every time the instance is rebooted.

EC2 instances types
    General Purpose, Compute Optimized, 
        Memory Optimized, Accelerated Compute Optimized, Storage Optimized, HPC Optimized, Instance Features, Measuring instance performance.
    AWS has following name conventions
        m5.2xlarge
            m: instance class
            5 is the generation (improves overtime)
            2xlarge size within the instance.


More on instances types
    General Purpose 
        Great for diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories.
        Balance between
            Compute 
            Memory 
            Networking
        Example: t2.micro
    Compute Optimized
        Great for compute intensive workloads or tasks, that require high performance processors:
            Batch processing
            Media transcoding
            Machine learning
            Scientific computing
            High-performance computing
            Data analytics
            Video processing
            AI/ML
        Example: c5.2xlarge
    Memory Optimized (RAM)
        Great for memory intensive workloads or tasks, that require high memory capacity:
        Use cases:
            High performances databases
            Distributed web scale cache stores
            Business intelligence
            Application performing real time analytics
        Example: r5.2xlarge
    Storage Optimized
        Great for storage intensive workloads or tasks, that require high storage capacity:
        Use cases:
            Data warehouses
            Big data analytics
            Batch processing
            Distributed file systems
            Cache for in-memory data
        example: starts with i, d, h

Security Groups (Firewalls around the instance)
    Control how traffic can enter and leave the instance.
    Security groups only contain allow rules 
    Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
    Good to know:
        Can be attached to multiple instances.
        Locked to region / VPC combination.
        It really a firewall running outside your EC2 instance.
        It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
        Application is not accessible (Timeoute), then it's a security group issue.
        But if your application gives a connection refused error, then it's a application issue.
        All in bound traffic is blocked by default.
        All out bound traffic is authorised by default.
    Classic ports to know:
        22 - SSH
        21 - FTP
        22 - SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload file using SSH
        80 - HTTP - access unsecured web application
        443 - HTTPS - access secured web application
        3389 - RDP - remote desktop protocol - log into window instance.


ec2 instance can be connected via 
    SSH
    intance connect

SSH overview
    ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@13.60.221.80

Use IAM role for EC2 instances. SO that you ec2 instance can access AWS services.

EC2 purchasing options
    On-Demand
        You pay for the time you use the instance.
    Reserved (1 & 3 years)
        You pay for the time you use the instance, and the instance is reserved for you.
        Reserved instances - long workloads
        Convertible Reserved intances - long workloads with flexible instance.
    Savings Plan (1 & 3 years) - commitement to an amount of usage, long workload.
    Spot Instances - Short workloads, cheap and can loose instances (Less reliable)
    Dedicated Hosts - Book an entire physical server, and use it as an EC2 instance.
    Dedicated Instances - No other customers will share the hardware
    Capacity Reservations - Reserved capacity for a specific time

Shared Responsibility Model for EC2
    AWS - Infrastructure, configuration and vulnerability anaylsis, Compliance validation.
    You - Security Groups
        Operating system patches and updates
        Software and utilities installed on EC2
        IAM roles assigned to EC2 instance and IAM user management
        Data security on your instance.
