EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance.
If you need high performance hardware disk, use EC2 instatnce store.

Better I/O performance, 
EC2 instance store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephermal)
Good for buffer, cache, and scratch data, temprorary content.
Risk of data loss if hardware fails
Backups and replication are your responsibility.
